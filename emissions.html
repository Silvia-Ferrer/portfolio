    <h1>CO2 EMISSIONS AND TEMPERATURE</h1>
    <h3>By Silvia Ferrer and Daniella Escobar</h3>
    <p>
      The main objective of this project was to understand the relationship between CO2 emissions, temperature, and time. 
      We also wanted to see a breakdown by country to understand how these countries have contributed to global emissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We combined 2 datasets from Kaggle: One contained global emissions data from the years 1750–2022, and went into the 
      details of the emission source, like oil, gas, flaring, or coal. The other dataset provided global temperature data 
      from roughly the same years and listed the average temperature per month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our research questions focus on the relationship between CO2 emissions, time, temperature, and countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s start with the relationship between time, temperature, and time and total emissions in the past century.
