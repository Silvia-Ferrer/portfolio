Me and my 

The main objective of this project was to understand the relationship between CO2 emissions, temperature, and time. We also wanted to see a breakdown by country
to understand how these countries have contributed to global emissions. We combined 2 datasets from Kaggle: One contained global emissions data from the years 1750-2022
and went into the details of the emission source, like oil, gas, flaring, or coal. The other dataset provided global temperature data from roughly the same years and
listed the average temperature per month. Our research questions focus on the relationship between CO2 emissions, time, temperature, and countries.

Let’s start with the relationship between time, temperature, and time and total emissions in the past century.

These two graphs show trend lines for the impact of time on the total global emissions and average temperature. In these graphs, time explains 99 and 44% of the variability in emissions and temperature, respectively. 

We can see that CO2 emissions have increased exponentially in the past decades, while temperature steadily increased with a lower slope. However, in recent years, we have not reached the lower average temperatures from those during the 20th century.

Now, let’s see how this increase in emissions through time gets distributed to the whole world.
