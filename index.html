      <h1>FEVA</h1>
      <h2>Hello! My name is Silvia Ferrer. <br/>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
      <p> <b>Feva</b> comes from two simple Latin roots: Silvia is connected to <i>silva</i>, the word for forest, which signals 
      things that grow, change, and spread chaotically; and Ferrer, which comes from <i>ferrum</i>, iron, a symbol of 
      structure and strength. Taken together, Feva fits a portfolio built on clear academic foundations 
      while still leaving room to explore, adapt, and try new things.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In this portfolio, I have created web pages for some of the projects I have worked on in recent years. 
    Each project has a title and a small description. Please click any title to see more.</p>
    <p>And of course, thank you so much for visiting. You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/silferrer/">LinkedIn</a> </p>

        <h3>SICSS Project: EPP Thesis</h3>
        <p>
          During the Summer Institute of Computational Social Science (SICSS) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 2025
           (organized by the CMU Libraries) I had the honor to be part of the SICSS Sense team for the final research project: we looked 
          into some trends among the dissertations of the PhD students 
          of the Engineering and Public Policy Department (EPP) of CMU.<br> For the presentation, we explained our research 
            journey and all the challenges we faced 
          using Joseph Campbell's The Journey of the Hero process.<br><br>We used the College's repository to download 
          the raw data, and R to clean, analyse, and graph it.

        <h3>Drug and Opioid Overdose Data Interactive Report in Racine County</h3>
        <p>
           At the Public Health Division of Racine County, Wisconsin, I analyzed data on suspected overdoses
        among Racine County residents, reported by emergency department visits between 2020 and 2023.<br>I used OpenRefine to clean data,
          and Power BI to digest it and create the report.
